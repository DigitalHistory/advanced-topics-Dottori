## Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive, and infectious disease which is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium Tuberculosis [1]. While this disease normally manifests itself in the lungs- causing chest pain, hemoptysis, and unintentional weight loss; TB can also present itself in other areas of the body [1]. Without treatment, Tuberculosis can be fatal. However, this disease presently has a cure, with a multitude of drugs currently available to treat patients. Unfortunately, despite the fact that there are drugs that can kill TB and a vaccine that can prevent it, tuberculosis still persists and pervades society today.

The existence of a cure notwithstanding, TB is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, and there are an estimated 10.4 million people globally who developed TB in 2013, with over 1.6 million people dying from the disease [2]. Countries with the highest rates of TB are also some of the poorest, and this disease is associated with overcrowding and poor sanitation; conditions which are ideal for TB bacteria to spread. Malnutrition, disease, and limited access to healthcare go hand in hand with poverty, and TB most strongly affects the vulnerable sector; impacting the poorest and most marginalized groups in any society [3].

## Stigma : The Voices of the White Death Trail
In this aspect, Tuberculosis remains unchanged from the White Death Trail that ravaged Ireland for much of the 1900s. Referred to as “consumption” by the common Irish layperson, this disease was aptly named, as it was a disease that would manifest itself with graphic violence – “consuming” its victims and leaving its host cachectic and short of breath [4]. During this time, there was a strong sense of fear and loathing that surrounded the diagnosis of TB. Seen as a poor man’s disease associated with the most marginalized sector of society, TB was at one point a disease with no cure, and eventually a disease that could singlehandedly afflict multiple generations of a family, and there was a pervasive stigma associated with the inexplicable disease that was devastating the nation. Ireland maintained one of the worst tuberculosis death rates in Europe, decades after rates started to decline in England [4]. Due to the mysterious nature of the disease at the time and its association with poverty, sufferers often hid their diagnoses and lived in fear that they would become social pariahs.

A reflection of the sentiment felt by the general population of Ireland would be a statement written by Dr. Woodcock of the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1912. Dr. Woodcock wrote that “Tubercle in truth is a coarse common disease, bred in foul breath, in dirt, in squalor… The beautiful and rich receive it from the unbeautiful poor… tubercle attacks failures” [5]. This comment from a well-educated man at the forefront of healthcare reflects the narrative of Tuberculosis in Northern Ireland at the time. In contrast to the present day, health was seen as a marker of class, with TB having the power to topple families even at the highest rungs of the social ladder. Oral accounts demonstrate the power of this disease to isolate and ostracize individuals. In one account, an elderly Irish woman retold a story from her childhood , saying “There was a stigma because it was such an infectious disease and people seemed to be getting it for no reason whatsoever. But of course, people who were living in bad conditions were more prone to it. I remember, actually, my own mother telling us not to play with so and so because there was TB in the family – I remember that” [6]. Associated with failure and impurity, Tuberculosis was thought to be the manifestation of failure; a turning point in one's life that would end relationships and job prospects.

Tuberculosis was seen as a disruptor, a cause of class anxiety, and a reflection of the socioeconomic inequalities that existed within Ireland at the time. Tuberculosis hit Ireland at a time where the nation was experiencing extreme economic hardship.  Plagued by poverty and emigration after winning independence from the United Kingdom, Ireland was suffering from extreme unemployment, with a proliferation of urban slums [7]. Upon being diagnosed with TB, one man said that “overnight I had joined the ghetto of tuberculosis lepers in Irish life” [5]. Audio clips from survivors of this disease confirm this sentiment, with one man stating that consumption was  “[…] a word that people spat out. He’s got consumption – you know. Or she’s got consumption! Right now-a-days you got ru- gallopin’ cancer you know and it wears on you the […] there’s a stigma that people did do everything about to hide” [6]. Tuberculosis was a symptom of a greater disease in the socioeconomic structure of Ireland, a sickness of the nation as a whole; the result of fear, marginalization, and an absence of compassion during a time of unease and uncertainty; an example of a broader social phenonemon brought upon by a suffering and conflicted nation.
